## Campus - Maps

### App Description
Allows students to route their classes based on their schedule, reducing the need to constantly check where each individual class is.

### App Idea Evaluation

- Mobile: The app would be strictly mobile to allow user to input their class location information and use maps to navigate them.
- Story: Allows students to navigate a brand new campus to them easier.
- Market: Unique app market, this app would be specific to college students who are new on campus.
- Habit: Transfer students and freshman students would easily enjoy this app because it would be their first time on a new campus.
- Scope: There are many entities that would have to go into this app such as choosing a map API, getting the students schedule and putting into a data set and then using that data set to create a route (or schedule).
