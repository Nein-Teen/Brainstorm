## Favorite Existing Apps - Categorize and Evaluate
### Instagram
- **Category:** Photo & Video / Social 
   - **Mobile:** App is predominantly for mobile experience but also has limited use on websites (view-only, no direct messaging)
   - **Story:** Allows users to share pictures of their lives, look at fresh memes and interact with their friends.
   - **Market:** Enables users to edit and share pictures and videos of their lives. Hashtags ctegorize posts and allow for users to view a more specific category according to their interests.
   - **Habit:** Users are allowed to post multiple times a day, while being able to "like" and comment on their friend's posts. Features such as "stories" and "highlights" encourage users to use the app more frequently to keep a record of their days. 
   - **Scope:** Started out only for single picture and 15-second video sharing but has expanded to being able to share multiple pictures and minute-long videos.
### Snapchat
  - **Category:** Photo * Video / Social
    - **Mobile:** App is mobile only experience, with the focus on deleting pictures or stories after the user sets the time.
    - **Story:** Allows the user to share pictures or videos of their environment with their friends (or strangers if they want). 
    - **Market:** The market for Snapchat is huge at over 100 million users. 
    - **Habit:** Many people use this app every day as a source for entertainment and news. They also use it to check out the environments of people across the world.
    - **Scope:** Snapchat started as an app where people just shared pictures with eachother or to check on the stories of friends.
### Twitter
  - **Category:** Lifestyle / News & Magazines
    - **Mobile:** Website based and app based. However, on the app you can upload pictures straight from the camera of a smartphone.
    - **Story:** Twitter has become a place for politicans, celebrities and artists to share live updates with their audience on what they are doing. It also has become a place for people to share their ideas. Twitter does not completely desensitize speech. 
    - **Market:** Twitter is a one-of-a-kind-app that allows users to push live updates of their environment and allows people to keep up with news constantly.
    - **Habit:** Many people use Twitter as a source of news and the average consumer, depending on how many people they follow, use it to keep up with their favorite things.
    - **Scope:** Twitter used to be a basis for pushing out live tweets with only text and pictures. It has expanded to live video and even gifs.
### Youtube
  - **Category:** Video Entertainment
    - **Mobile:** Video + Audio, both on desktop and in app.
    - **Story:** Allows users to post videos onto website for others to watch.
    - **Market:** This app is for everyone to use, since the app has a plethora of videos for the users to watch.
    - **Habit:** Many people use this everyday for entertainment, news, tutorials, etc.
    - **Scope:** Youtube originally started as video version of an online dating site, but then later became video sharing webiste for many different kinds of content.
### Discord
  - **Category:** Social
    - **Mobile:** Audio + Real Time, mostly on desktop though as it is usually paired with some other group activity (gaming/projects/newsfeed for company) 
    - **Story:** Discord was meant for gamers who wanted a better resource to connect with others that did not want to use Teamspeak and Mumble, it has now become a place for everyone who wants to join a community like their own.
    - **Market:** Large market of online gamers, has benefits such as no fps loss and little memory usage to people who will run a large program alongside it
    - **Habit:** Once a day/every other day at minimum, more for an expected "work" in advance, mix of view/create, though creating is rather minimal (messages/sharing files)
    - **Scope:** Benefits of using Discord over similar apps such as Slack/Google Hangouts/Skype are fairly universal, able to appeal to its demographic by sorting through other apps' features
     Main functions (communication + file sharing) should be doable, rest might be hard to pull off, smaller version may be still interesting to build (in my opinion) as it introduces a real-time aspect to coding.
     
## New App Ideas - List
1. On-Campus Route Maker
    - Allows students to route their classes based on their schedule, reducing the need to constantly check where each individual class is.
3. Campus Schedule Former
    - Finds possible schedules given a set of classes + sections.

Point system can be used for each trail (harder trails earn user more points). Experience level of user will be increased as they gain more points.
4. Pet Care
    - User will open the app and click on the kind of issue his/her pet is having (injury, sickness, etc.). The app would then contact any veterinarians nearby about the pet, and one would respond and drive over to the location to treat the pet.
